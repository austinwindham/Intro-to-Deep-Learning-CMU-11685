# Homework 4 Part 2 Submission

## Introduction / How to Run the Code

In this homework, I implmented a transformer for text generation. The code runs as normal, and you just need to run the python notebook.

## Ablations

I did not do much for my ablations, and my team did not even keep a log. I implemented beam search and expanded the model until it reached close to the max parameters. I also set the specaug parameter to true. I only inferenced with beam search, and I found that my best results were with 10. I really did not do a lot of trials and hit the high cutoff early, so I stopped. I also ran for 20 epochs.
